## Laravel Livewire Datatables

This is an example of how Laravel Livewire Datatables can be setup quickly with good performance.

In this repository there is a single Database component for Users which has been
selected as there is sensitive fields which need to be excluded, so it is a good example to use.

There is various functionality demonstrated such as:

- Component which renders records from a builder resolved on the model
- Pagination
- Searching
- Bulk Actions ie allowing multiple records to be selected and actioned.
